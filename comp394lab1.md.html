The  worlds and levels in different themes which are 2D side-scrolling environments.

*Players*

The game supports both single-player and multiplayer gameplay, players can choose the character Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Toad, Yoshi, or Nabbit. Some of them have special abilities.

*Goals*

The goal is to navigate through all the levels, utilizing collectibles and power-ups along the way. Players must avoid enemy attacks and overcome obstacles to stay alive until they reach the gate that leads to the next level.

*Rules*

Players have both lives and health; losing all of either will result in a Game Over. Colliding with enemies causes damage to health or loss of life, depending on the player's current state. To defend against enemies, players can jump on them or use fireballs to attack and defeat them. Additionally, falling off platforms or running out of time will instantly trigger a Game Over.

Which elements were easy to identify, which ones were hard?
==============================================================
Objects are easy to identify as it is basically every thing you see in the game; Rules are hard to identify as they may not be listed in the game but you have to figure it out by yourself.
